Fixes #666 

**Summary of Changes**

1. Update `Route` method documentation comments where the example in the
comments showed a `Router` before. Updated method names include:
    * `Headers`
    * `HeadersRegexp`
    * `Host`
    * `Path`
    * `Queries`
    * `Subrouter`
    * `URL`

Notes:
* This includes what PR #667 did plus some changes requested by a
maintainer in the comments
* I was a little torn about changing the example in `Subrouter` since
`(*Router).Host()` (like several `(*Router)` methods) just calls
`(*Router).NewRoute().Host()` so I understand if maintainers are
ambivalent about that example or want it to remain the same.
