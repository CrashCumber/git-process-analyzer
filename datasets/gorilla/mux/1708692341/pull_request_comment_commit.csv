```go
func main() {

	r := mux.NewRouter()
	r.Host(""{domain}"").
		Path(""/{group}/{item_id}"").
		Queries(""some_data1"", ""{some_data1}"").

		HandlerFunc(Func).
		Name(""article"")
	fmt.Println(r.Get(""article"").GetVarNames())
	http.ListenAndServe("":8000"", r)

}
```` 

`GetVarNames` will print `[domain group item_id some_data1 some_data2] <nil>`

Exactly, I just only wanted to update readme file. Just to show case that proposal change is valid I wrote these test cases. If we all agree to `README.md` change. I would be happy to remove these test cases because It is not doing anything as you already mentioned.

Let me know what do you guys think?
