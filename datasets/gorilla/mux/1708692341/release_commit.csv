Middleware are handlers that can intercept request & response processing *after a route match*, but before/after other handlers are invoked. See the documentation for the full details: https://github.com/gorilla/mux#middleware

Previously, developers would have to use a thin wrapper to achieve this per-application. Requests for this functionality built up enough over time such that we've added it to mux's built-in methods.
